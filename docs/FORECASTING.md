## Introduction to Forecasting

### What is Time Series Forecasting?
Time series forecasting uses historical data patterns to predict future values. It's essential for:
- **Revenue Planning**: Predict next quarter's sales
- **Demand Forecasting**: Inventory and supply chain planning
- **Resource Allocation**: Staffing and capacity planning
- **Budgeting**: Financial projections and cost estimation

### Key Concepts

#### 1. Components of Time Series
- **Trend**: Long-term increase or decrease
- **Seasonality**: Regular patterns (weekly, monthly, yearly)
- **Cyclical**: Long-term oscillations (not fixed period)
- **Noise**: Random variations

#### 2. Forecast Horizon
- **Short-term**: 1-7 days (operational planning)
- **Medium-term**: 1-3 months (tactical planning)
- **Long-term**: 3+ months (strategic planning)

#### 3. Prediction Intervals
- **Point Estimate**: Single predicted value
- **Confidence Interval**: Range of likely values (e.g., 95% CI)
- **Uncertainty**: Increases with forecast horizon

## Model Selection Guide

### Decision Tree

```
Do you have < 50 data points?
├── Yes → Exponential Smoothing
└── No → Continue

Is your data seasonal?
├── No → ARIMA
└── Yes → Continue

What's your data frequency?
├── Daily/Sub-daily → Prophet
├── Weekly → Prophet or SARIMA
├── Monthly → SARIMA
└── Yearly → ARIMA

Do you have 1000+ data points?
├── Yes → Consider LSTM
└── No → Use Prophet/SARIMA

Need maximum accuracy (complex patterns)?
├── Yes → LSTM (if enough data)
└── No → Prophet (simpler, robust)
```

### Quick Reference Table

| Scenario | Best Model | Second Choice | Why |
|----------|-----------|---------------|-----|
| Daily sales, 6 months history | Prophet | SARIMA | Handles daily patterns well |
| Monthly revenue, 5 years | SARIMA | Prophet | Perfect for monthly seasonality |
| Hourly website traffic | LSTM | Prophet | Complex patterns, large dataset |
| Weekly signups, 1 year | Prophet | SARIMA | Robust to missing data |
| Quarterly earnings, 10 years | ARIMA | Exponential Smoothing | Long-term trend focus |
| Daily stock prices | LSTM | ARIMA | Non-linear, complex |
| Seasonal retail sales | SARIMA | Prophet | Strong seasonality |

## Evaluation Metrics

### Understanding Forecast Accuracy

#### 1. MAPE (Mean Absolute Percentage Error)
```python
# How far off predictions are (in %)
MAPE = (1/n) × Σ |Actual - Forecast| / |Actual| × 100

Interpretation:
├── <5%:  Excellent
├── 5-10%: Good
├── 10-20%: Acceptable
├── 20-50%: Poor
└── >50%: Very Poor

Example:
Actual: $100,000
Forecast: $107,000
Error: 7% → Good forecast
```

#### 2. RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)
```python
# Average magnitude of errors (same units as data)
RMSE = √[(1/n) × Σ(Actual - Forecast)²]

Interpretation:
- Lower is better
- Sensitive to large errors
- Compare across models (same data)

Example:
RMSE = $5,000 for daily sales
→ Average error is ~$5K per day
```

#### 3. MAE (Mean Absolute Error)
```python
# Average absolute error (same units)
MAE = (1/n) × Σ|Actual - Forecast|

Interpretation:
- More robust than RMSE
- Direct error magnitude
- Easy to explain to stakeholders

Example:
MAE = $3,500
→ On average, predictions off by $3,500
```

#### 4. R² (Coefficient of Determination)
```python
# How much variance is explained
R² = 1 - (SS_residual / SS_total)

Interpretation:
├── 0.9-1.0: Excellent fit
├── 0.7-0.9: Good fit
├── 0.5-0.7: Moderate fit
└── <0.5:   Poor fit

Example:
R² = 0.87
→ Model explains 87% of variance
```

### Model Comparison Example

```python
Scenario: Forecasting Monthly Revenue

Model Results:
┌─────────────────┬───────┬─────────┬─────────┬──────┐
│ Model           │ MAPE  │ RMSE    │ MAE     │ R²   │
├─────────────────┼───────┼─────────┼─────────┼──────┤
│ Exp. Smoothing  │ 12.3% │ $8,500  │ $6,200  │ 0.78 │
│ ARIMA           │ 9.8%  │ $7,200  │ $5,100  │ 0.84 │
│ SARIMA          │ 6.5%  │ $4,800  │ $3,600  │ 0.91 │✓
│ Prophet         │ 7.2%  │ $5,200  │ $3,900  │ 0.89 │
│ LSTM            │ 5.8%  │ $4,200  │ $3,100  │ 0.93 │✓
└─────────────────┴───────┴─────────┴─────────┴──────┘

Winner: LSTM (best metrics)
Alternative: SARIMA (simpler, still excellent)
```

## Advanced Techniques

### 1. Multi-variate Forecasting

**Concept**: Use multiple input variables to improve predictions.

**Example**: Forecasting Sales
```python
Input Features:
├── Historical Sales (target)
├── Marketing Spend
├── Competitor Prices
├── Economic Indicators
└── Weather Data

Model: Vector Autoregression (VAR) or LSTM

Benefits:
✓ Captures cross-variable relationships
✓ Improves accuracy
✓ Provides scenario analysis capability
```

### 2. Ensemble Forecasting

**Concept**: Combine multiple models for better predictions.

**Methods**:
```python
1. Simple Average:
   Forecast = (Model1 + Model2 + Model3) / 3

2. Weighted Average:
   Forecast = 0.5×Prophet + 0.3×SARIMA + 0.2×ARIMA

3. Stacking:
   Use meta-model to combine base models
```

**Implementation**:
```python
# In Dashboard:
Ensemble Settings:
├── Models to Combine:
│   ✓ Prophet (weight: 0.4)
│   ✓ SARIMA (weight: 0.35)
│   ✓ ARIMA (weight: 0.25)
├── Combination Method: Weighted Average
└── Weights: Based on validation MAPE

Result:
Ensemble MAPE: 5.2%
(Better than any single model!)
```

### 3. Hierarchical Forecasting

**Concept**: Forecast at different aggregation levels and reconcile.

**Example**: Retail Chain
```python
Hierarchy:
Total Company Sales
├── Region A
│   ├── Store 1
│   └── Store 2
└── Region B
    ├── Store 3
    └── Store 4

Process:
1. Forecast each level independently
2. Reconcile to ensure consistency
3. Bottom-up or top-down approach
```

### 4. External Regressors

**Concept**: Include external factors that influence your target.

**Example**: E-commerce Sales
```python
Target: Daily Sales
External Factors:
├── Marketing Spend (controllable)
├── Holidays (calendar)
├── Promotions (planned)
├── Competitor Pricing (external)
└── Weather (external)

Model: Prophet with Regressors
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### Issue 1: Poor Forecast Accuracy

**Symptoms**: MAPE >20%, predictions way off

**Diagnosis**:
```python
Check:
□ Sufficient historical data (30+ points)?
□ Data quality (no errors/outliers)?
□ Right model for pattern (seasonality)?
□ Stable historical patterns?
```

**Solutions**:
1. Gather more historical data
2. Clean outliers and errors
3. Try different models
4. Use ensemble methods
5. Add external variables

#### Issue 2: Model Won't Converge

**Symptoms**: Training fails, error messages

**Diagnosis**:
```python
Check:
□ Data is stationary (for ARIMA)?
□ No missing values?
□ Appropriate frequency?
□ Reasonable parameter values?
```

**Solutions**:
1. Apply differencing for ARIMA
2. Handle missing values (interpolate)
3. Verify date frequency is correct
4. Use auto-parameter selection
5. Try simpler model first

#### Issue 3: Wide Prediction Intervals

**Symptoms**: Huge confidence intervals, uncertain forecasts

**Diagnosis**:
```python
Check:
□ High data volatility?
□ Long forecast horizon?
□ Limited historical data?
□ Unstable patterns?
```

**Solutions**:
1. Reduce forecast horizon
2. Add more historical data
3. Include external predictors
4. Use ensemble methods
5. Accept uncertainty, plan scenarios

#### Issue 4: Seasonal Pattern Not Detected

**Symptoms**: Model misses obvious seasonality

**Diagnosis**:
```python
Check:
□ Enough seasonal cycles (2+ years)?
□ Regular seasonal period?
□ Model supports seasonality?
□ Correct frequency specified?
```

**Solutions**:
1. Use SARIMA or Prophet
2. Manually specify seasonal period
3. Gather more seasonal cycles
4. Try seasonal decomposition first
